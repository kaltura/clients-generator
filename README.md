# Kaltura Client Generator
The code in this repo is used to auto generate the Kaltura client libraries for each supported language.

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPLv3-blue.svg)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)

## Deployment Instructions
The list of supported clients is [here](config/generator.all.ini)

Download the API scheme XML from http://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/api_schema.php.

To generate one client run:
```
$ php /opt/kaltura/clients-generator/exec.php -x/path-to-xml/KalturaClient.xml $CLIENT_NAME
```

For example, to generate a `php53` client run:
```
php /opt/kaltura/clients-generator/exec.php -x/path-to-xml/KalturaClient.xml php53
```

To generate all available clients, run:
```
while read CLIENT;do php /opt/kaltura/clients-generator/exec.php -x/path-to-xml/KalturaClient.xml $CLIENT;done < /opt/kaltura/clients-generator/config/generator.all.ini
```
