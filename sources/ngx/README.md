This library uses `Typescript` files that are transpiled  into `ECMAScript 5` using `commonjs` as a module system.

This library have **_zero dependencies_** at runtime and it can be used in any Javascript project. Those who are using Typescript will benefit even more.

# Building the sources
> This library is auto-generated using `kaltura/clients-generator` php engine. Feel free to clone, build and play with this library but in order to submit PR you should work against the [kaltura/clients-generator](https://github.com/kaltura/clients-generator) repo.


## Adding this library as a dependency to your project
Since this library was designed to be consumed directly and not using npmjs repository, you will need to do the following steps to add it to your project:
1. run the following to transpile the library:
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run deploy
```
2. open folder `dist` and find a `tar.gz` file starging with `kaltura-ngx-client-v`.
3. copy this file to your project (we recommend coping it to folder `libs`)
4. run the following command
 ```
 npm install file:the_path_to_the_file_includeing_its_name
 ```
> make sure you prefix the path with `file:` as shown above.

An example of a vaild command will be: `npm install file:libs/kaltura-ngx-client-v7.1.0-20173010-1053.tgz`

5. if you already have older version, delete that file. You should do this only after you installed the new version.

## Running integration tests
- In `src/api/tests` folder you should duplicate file `tests-config.template.ts` and name it `tests-config.ts`.
- Modify the file content to include valid information.
- Run `npm run test` to test the library

> If you want to test the library against the production server use the following as the endpoint in the config file: http://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/index.php/
